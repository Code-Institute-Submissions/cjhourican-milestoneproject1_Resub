CSS User Centric Front End


FinSpec
A lean introductory website to a fictional fintech company called FinSpec. This is a SaaS product that can be used by businesses and provides a range of services that are structured into a number of key tiers depending on the business availing of the services needs. The goal is to provide simple information in an easily digestible manner to the potential use. This is a B2B product. 
The primary goal of the service is to get people to sign up by providing their email address. It is envisioned that card details would be a requirement in a typical scenario, however, allowing for such a facility is beyond the scope of what I can accomplish at this stage of my progress through the programme. The users of this site would be very matter-of-fact buyers who know what they want and simply want straight-forward information without much fuss. Therefore, the information will be simple.
The business goals are:
Sign up customers
Acquire customers information
Provide easily accessible information about what each of the packages provide
Build Brand awareness
Drive sales
The customers goals are:
To manage their finances more effectively
To understand the difference between the services offered
To make a decision about what they want 
Client stories
Clients are looking for a software solution to their financial needs and FinSpec provides them with this
It is seen as a service unique from a bank where by clients can circumvent stringent rules and receive support for what they need
These clients will be busy and supported by the ability to make quick decisions around a service that will save them time and make finance easier to manage thus greatly offsetting the cost.

UX
As most searches are now completed online using phones it is important to make the site mobile responsive. In this vein I will relied a lot on bootstrap. 
I had initially wanted to provide all of the relevant information on one page, however this was deemed as limited and I would like to give the site a navbar (both to utilise this aspect of what I have learned and also make the site easier to navigate). The call to action page is the Sign Up Today page and a direct link to this should feature on the home page. I will also include social media icon at the end of each page so there will be some cross over in what I do here. 
Home
The home page includes a well styles and somewhat dream-like settling that also suggests sleekness and something futuristic. It will feature a quote and also some information on what FinSpec offers. There will also be a quote on this page for someone to read and understand the value of what is on offer. 
The nav here will create a link to each page but there will also be a direct call to action to the Sign Up Today page or a call to action (in case the user already knows what they wants and is merely submitting an order.)
Pricing
I will use a simple grid system with three columns on the home page. The Pricing page will feature the same design and contain three separate columns with each of the prices. 
About
The about page will contain a picture of the owner (in this case envisioned as me) and some (fictional) text about the back story and history of the company. 
Sign Up Today
The Sign Up page will contain two boxes to input an email address and select an option before clicking on a sign up button. 

The lean approach is in line with perhaps the profile of the user and their ambitions for making swift decision with simple and straightforward information.
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

Testing:
The most common pathway through the website would be envisioned as:
•	Home > Pricing > Sign Up Today
•	There is a call to action button on the home page, pricing page, each leading to the Sign Up Today. There is no call to action on the about page as this is seen as secondary to the service offered, and not a key page, but ancillary information. Page. The home page call to action is a button with “join the revolution” an attempt to highlight the unique nature of this imaginary SaaS product.
Testing client stories from UX section of README.md
1.	The Nav bar is seen as essential is directing potential customers throughout the site. 
2.	Information is to be found on the pricing page and each lead to the Sign Up Today page. 
3.	The Sign Up Today page is seen as the end goal of the site. It is also envisaged that in the imaginary work of FInSpec the brand already has significant recognition (similar to Revolut) and visitors are familiar with it and simply want to sign up or clarify the pricing structure.
4.	Furthermore, given the expected profile of the user the site is seen as being an order-taking platform as opposed to a comprehensive informative sales and marketing tool.
