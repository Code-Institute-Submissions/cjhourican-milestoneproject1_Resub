            <h6 class="abouttext">
                FinSpec is the brainchild of Ciarán Hourican a former hedgefund manager and his business partners at H-Training,
 a training company he took over in 2014 and developed into a global brand. Having sold this company in 2021 Ciarán 
 and a number of key investors embarked on a highly-successful fund-raising venture to develop a more busines-oriented 
 financial SaaS Company. Recognising the need for businesses to fund themselves without having to deal with the limiting 
 practices of banks they set up a loan book that accommodated businesses in ground-breaking ways. By altering the traditional 
 banking framework the company was able to attract a huge following in a very short space of time. The result of this was FinSpec 
 an award winning financial juggernaut of world renown.
 
 The company has since gone from strength to strength and has branched off into financial speculation, where traders, based on a series of 
 algorithms developed in conjunction with a variety of different financial and economic schools of thought, can make real-time and informed
 decisions around their investments. This new facility has become the lynch-pin of the financial world and disrupted another host of 
 financial practices and continues to go from strength to strength.
